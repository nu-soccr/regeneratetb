Regenerative Shift assists in the transition steps (large or little) that businesses and individuals want to make to create resiliency and a connection with nature. We aim to simplify and connect new technologies, ancient wisdom, business thinking, and radical ideas into actionable steps to begin the regenerative shift! We also aim to be a source for education and inspiration around regenerative practices, many of which aren't yet broadly known.

Regenerative Shift's mission is in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through our work, we most actively prioritize our efforts around six of these SDGs:


#### Goal 2: Zero Hunger
End hunger, improve nutrition, achieve food security, and promote sustainable agriculture.

#### Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

#### Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.

#### Goal 13: Climate Action
Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

#### Goal 14: Life Below Water
Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources.

#### Goal 15: Life on Land
Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

## Message from the Founder

**Caleb Quaid, MBA, LEED, AP BD+C**


Hi, I’m Caleb. I formed Regenerative Shift in 2021 because I saw so much hope and potential in the little regenerative changes we can all make, and not enough discussion and action!
Our mission is simple and yet ground-breaking: to put life at the center of business.
When life is considered, often beautiful, cost-effective, holistic solutions come to the forefront.  When coupled with what I call the “low-hanging fruit” of sustainability -- which often many businesses aren’t yet picking -- the business case for true environmental impact is undeniable.  

We are at a turning point in history, where the story of unlimited natural resources and continuous growth is no longer working, and businesses need to shift towards growth in connection with nature, its resources, and the biodiversity of life or be left behind in the transition.  I saw the opportunity to help businesses navigate this changing business world and formed Regenerative Shift to do that.

My background was in professional sports, where I worked for 12 years in the NFL, mostly with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. I oversaw stadium operations and capital projects and had a blast in my dream job (and even got a Super Bowl ring!). But in 2021, I realized that it was time to make a shift towards being a part of the more beautiful world that I know is possible, and Regenerative Shift was born.

Let’s shift together!

Caleb Quaid
