Regenerative Shift assists in the transition steps (large or little) that businesses and individuals want to make to create resiliency and a connection with nature. Regenerative Shift simplifies and connects new technologies, ancient wisdom, business thinking, and radical ideas into actionable steps to begin the regenerative shift! We also aim to be a source for education and inspiration around regenerative practices, many of which aren't yet broadly known.

Regenerative Shift's mission is in alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Through our work, we most actively prioritize our efforts around six of these SDGs:


#### Goal 2: Zero Hunger
End hunger, improve nutrition, achieve food security, and promote sustainable agriculture.

#### Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

#### Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns.

#### Goal 13: Climate Action
Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.

#### Goal 14: Life Below Water
Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources.

#### Goal 15: Life on Land
Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss.

## About Caleb

![caleb](/img/quaid.jpg)


Hi, I'm Caleb. I formed Regenerative Shift because I see so much hope and life in the little regenerative changes we can make, and not enough people know it! Our mission is simple: to promote, educate, and assist in the transition to regenerative practices!

Regeneration can create habitat and biodiversity, clean watersheds, draw down carbon from the atmosphere, and provide healthy food and water for humans and all other life. It has been proven to work on large and small scales, in climates all over the world. It's hard to overstate the beautiful difference we can make with regeneration!

I think that most of us know that what we are doing isn't sustainable and that the jig is almost up.

We are at a turning point in history, where the story of unlimited natural resources and continuous growth is no longer working, and that business and development will need to shift towards growth in connection with nature, its resources, and the biodiversity of life.

My background was in professional sports, where I worked for 12 years in the NFL, mostly with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. I oversaw stadium operations and capital projects and had a blast in my dream job (and even got a Super Bowl ring!). But in 2021, I realized that it was time to make a shift towards being a part of the more beautiful world that I know is possible, and Regenerative Shift was born.

Let's shift together!
