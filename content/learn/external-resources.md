## Doom and Gloom 

When there are beautiful examples of regeneration and the opportunity to focus on proven practices to bring back life and stability to the climate, we don't like to focus on the doom and gloom. But, if you do, here are some alarming realities about the climate change and mass extinction crisis we face:
    
- **Climate**
    - **United Nations: IPCC report 'Code red for humanity'** ([Link](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362 "United Nations: IPCC report 'Code red for humanity'"))  
        234 scientists from 66 countries spent 5 years studying climate change. In July 2021, this report was published, saying definitively that immediate action is needed to mitigate irreversible crisis.
    - **NASA: Climate Change: How Do We Know?** ([Link](https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/ "NASA: Climate Change: How Do We Know?"))  
        All the facts and numbers. Dig as deep as you'd like into the science here.
    
    - **Extinction**
        - **Nature's emergency: where we are in five graphics** ([Link](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-48104037 "Nature's emergency: where we are in five graphics"))  
            Not-so-pretty charts.
        - **Global Study: Over 40% of insect species are threatened with extinction** ([Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320718313636 "Global Study: Over 40% of insect species are threatened with extinction"))  
            Pesticides might not be a good idea.
        - **Plummeting insect numbers 'threaten collapse of nature'** ([Link](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/10/plummeting-insect-numbers-threaten-collapse-of-nature "Plummeting insect number 'threaten collapse of nature'"))  
            A global decline of 41% of the insect population between 2009-2019? Almost half the insects in the world gone in a decade.
        - **Red tide by the numbers** ([Link](https://stpetecatalyst.com/red-tide-by-the-numbers-3-65-million-pounds-of-dead-fish-2-1-million-in-expenditures-so-far/ "Red tide by the numbers"))  
            Massive fish kill in Tampa Bay in July 2021 caused in no small part by pollution.
        - **The incredible shrinking Colorado River** ([Link](https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.9/infographic-drought-the-incredible-shrinking-colorado-river "The incredible shrinking Colorado River "))  
            A quarter of the US is running out of water.
        - **Salmon collapse in Alaska** ([Link](https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/rural-alaska/2021/09/04/weve-never-seen-this-before-salmon-collapse-sends-alaskans-on-lower-yukon-scrambling-for-scarce-alternatives/ "Salmon collapse in Alaska"))  
            Just one of many species that are in decline.
