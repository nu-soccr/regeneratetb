"We are excited to welcome Caleb Quaid, the founder and owner of [Regenerative Shift](https://www.regenerativeshift.com/about.html). Caleb’s background is in professional sports, as he worked for 12 years in the NFL overseeing stadium operations and capital projects. In 2021, Caleb had a personal realization that the story of unlimited natural resources and continuous growth is no longer working, and that business and development will need to shift towards growth in connection with nature, its resources, and the biodiversity of life. Out of this personal call, Regenerative Shift was born! Now, the company works to promote, educate, and assist in the transition to regenerative practices, all in alignment with the [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/news/communications-material/) (SDGs)."
