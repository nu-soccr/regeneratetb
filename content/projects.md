## Raymond James Stadium Living Fence

In February 2022, Raymond James Stadium installed an 1,100 ft 
living fence of bamboo and native plants to provide an 
environmentally-friendly barrier to stop unauthorized vehicle 
access to their property.

In lieu of an aluminum fence, which is extractive, this living fence 
sequesters carbon and provides habitat for native wildlife. 

The project is considered the first regenerative planting project in 
North American professional sports and garnered TV news.
