The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is the largest environmental legislation in US history and provides unprecedented incentives for businesses, individuals, non-profits, and public entities to invest in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon reduction projects. Regenerative Shift provides holistic consulting services to help you navigate the incentives and regulations of the Inflation Reduction Act. As you consider your upcoming projects, consider how this landmark funding opportunity can help with funding. 

3. ### Regenerative Land Management

>_"No civilization has outlived the usefulness of its soils. When the soil is destroyed, the nation is gone."_

>-Lloyd Noble, 1949
Founder of the Noble Research Institute

Regenerative land management is a system of principles and practices that increase biodiversity, enrich soils, improve watersheds, and enhance ecosystems. When management regeneratively, soil can absorb tons of carbon (literally) and be part of reversing current global trends of atmospheric accumulation and climate change. Regenerative land sequesters carbon, reduces/eliminates the need for irrigation, fertilizers, and pesticides, and can yield, if desired, high amounts of organic food to provide new resilient revenue sources.

Regenerative land management can be done in conjunction with other business goals and land uses and can be a small part or a large part of your organization’s sustainability strategy.


4. ### LEED Consulting / Project Management

The most successful green projects are created when all members of the project team - owner, design team, contractor, operators - are connected and aligned on the vision. Regenerative Shift can be a catalyst for that alignment.

Throughout concept development, design, construction, commissioning, and operations, Regenerative Shift can support project LEED certification goals and provide guidance on the path to obtain this industry-recognized sustainability certification, and how to fit this project into your overall sustainability program.
