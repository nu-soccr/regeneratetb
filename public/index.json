[{"content":"\rThe Loess Plateau restoration in China is the largest scale regenerative land restoration project to date, restoring over 35,000 square kilometers (an area the size of Belgium) between 1995 and 2007. This land was barren for thousands of years prior to restoration, showing an incredible case example of the power of regenerative practices to restore degraded ecosystems.\nWhat is Regeneration? \u0026ldquo;Regeneration means putting life at the center of every action and decision. It\u0026rsquo;s an inclusive and effective strategy to end the climate crisis in one generation.\u0026rdquo;\nPaul Hawken, Author of \u0026ldquo;Regeneration: Ending the climate crisis in one generation\u0026rdquo;\nUntil recently, almost all talk on regeneration focused on regenerative agriculture and land restoration projects. As the benefits of regeneration continue to be proven in larger studies, regeneration is becoming a movement that rethinks traditional communities, industries, and businesses through a lens of connection with nature and restoring life through our actions.\nIn contrast to traditional industrial agriculture, which uses fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and unsustainable irrigation to grow mostly monoculture crops, regenerative agriculture focuses first on soil health as the building block for a healthy food production system. Healthy soil grows healthy food, cleans water, provides habitat for wildlife, and pulls Co2 out of the atmosphere and turns it into organic carbon in the soil and plants.\nRegenerative land restoration projects focus on capturing rainwater and storing it in the soil as the basis for restoring local ecosystems with world-changing potential! The Loess Plateau project, for example, restored 35,000 square kilometers (an area the size of the country of Belgium) from barren land to thriving farm and pasture in just a 12-year period using regenerative practices. Similar projects all over the world have shown that even in harshest environments (like Rwandan and Ethiopian deserts), regeneration can bring life back from the dead.\nRegenerative buildings rethink the built environment, focusing on incorporating nature into design through integrated environmental design and biomimicry (learning and mimicking nature\u0026rsquo;s strategies to solve human design issues). Increasingly, communities and construction projects are looking at cutting-edge design solutions, like the Living Building Challenge, to create buildings that are a benefit to the surrounding environment.\nRegenerative communities are also emerging around the world. They aim to support all life and human lifestyle in a way that creates health, happiness, and connection. These communities focus on local resiliency, habitat preservation, sustainable energy use, and connection with nature.\nRegeneration puts life at the center of decision-making, which leads to projects, systems and communities that are more resilient and adapted to changing political and environmental challenges. As the movement grows, regeneration can be expanded to regional, national, and global levels, to help realize the more beautiful world that our hearts know is possible.\nWant to discuss your regenerative shift? Let\u0026rsquo;s talk!\nWhy Regeneration? Draw Down Carbon! We have a carbon problem. Well, really, we have a pollution problem. Carbon itself isn\u0026rsquo;t bad\u0026hellip; it is the building block of all life on earth. But, when we pollute carbon into the atmosphere heavily, it has consequences, including climate change. While stopping pollution and carbon emissions are critical, we also need solutions to drawdown the carbon that is already polluted.\nRegenerative soil management can sequester massive amounts of carbon if scaled globally. According to at least one study, we could sequester 100% of our annual CO2 emissions if all global cropland and pasture were regenerative. Oversimplified, plants breathe in CO2, breathe out oxygen, and keep the carbon. The world\u0026rsquo;s soil holds triple the carbon that is in the atmosphere! By using regenerative practices to increase the carbon in the soil, we can drawdown the carbon in the atmosphere and mitigate climate change.\nBuild and Sustain Life! When soil is healthy, it has more microorganisms in one handful than we have people on the planet. These small organisms are the foundation of the ecosystem and support all plant, insect, animal, and human life, along with making beautiful healthy soil. As we look for solutions to this great mass extinction, creating habitat through regenerative practices is one of the great opportunities before us!\n","permalink":"https://regeneratetampabay.org/resource-library/intro-to-regeneration/","summary":"A place to start if regeneration is totally new to you.","title":"Intro to Regeneration"},{"content":"Morning Location Time Activity Meet in front of Farmhouse 10:00 - 10:30am Sweetwater Farm Tour with Cristy Abbott Main Stage 10:30 - 11:00am Opening Circle Main Stage 11:00 - 11:45am Intergenerational Exploration Workshop with Donna Angelou Farm House 11:00 - 12:00pm Regenerative Business Panel Connections Barn All morning Connections Mapping / We Regenerate Market All morning Vending and Tabling Early Afternoon Location Time Activity Meet in front of Farmhouse 12:30 - 1:30pm Learning from Nature Workshop with Liztere Fiol and Caleb Quaid Zone 00 1:30 - 2:30pm Thai Massage Workshop with Tim Witting Farmhouse 12:30 - 1:15pm Intro to Permaculture w/ Bill Bilodeau School House 1:30 - 2:15pm Heart Walk Celebration w/ Cindy Casterlin Main Stage 1:30 - 2:30pm Food System Panel Meet in front of Farmhouse 1:30 - 2:30pm Rainwater Harvesting Tour with Diane Willis School House 2:30 - 3:15pm Toy Swap Connections Barn All afternoon Connections Mapping / We Regenerate Market All afternoon Vending and Tabling Late Afternoon Location Time Activity Main Stage 3:00 - 4:00pm Land and Water Use Panel Zone 00 3:00 - 4:00pm Sound Healing w/ Jennifer McClure School House 3:30 - 4:15pm Garden Grampa Lasagna Composting with Albert Risemberg Main Stage 4:30 - 6:00pm Elder Wisdom Panel Zone 00 5:00 - 5:45pm Zone 00 All Ages Embodiment with Tatiana Rodeiro Connections Barn All afternoon Connections Mapping / We Regenerate Market All afternoon Vending and Tabling Evening Location Time Activity Zone 00 6:30 - 9:00pm 00 Lounge Main Stage 6:30 - 7:30pm Idea Hour Fire Pit 7:00 - 9:00pm Fireside Chat / S\u0026rsquo;mores Main Stage 7:45 - 9:00pm Music with Sunya Connections Barn All afternoon Connections Mapping / We Regenerate Market All afternoon Vending and Tabling ","permalink":"https://regeneratetampabay.org/posts/schedule/","summary":"View the itinerary","title":"Schedule"},{"content":"\rElder Wisdom Panel Community elders share experience in a free-flowing dialogue style panel.\nBill Bilodeau, Urban Ag Elder\nKoreen Brennan, Grow Permaculture\nSharon Joy Kleitsch, Meta-Networker\nJungle Jay Hardman, Beacon Food Forest\nCristy Abbott, Permaculture Elder\nFood Systems Panel Discussion of food security and local food systems with public, non-profit, and permaculture representatives.\nMonica Petrella, Homegrown Hillsborough\nHarrison Soberanis, Dream Builders Mission\nAlbert Risemberg, Moon Landing Garden \u0026amp; Apiary\nJon Butts, EcoFarm\nErica Hall, Florida Food Policy Council\nJoe Dalessio, Meacham Urban Farm\nLand and Water Use Panel Discussion of issues involving land, water and climate in the Tampa Bay area, with permaculture, ecology, and policy change experts.\nKen Benway, Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice\nSusan Glickman, CLEO Institute / Policy Advocate\nDiane Willis, Wetland Scientist and Rainwater Harvesting Expert\nRegenerative Business Local entrepreneurs discuss navigating business with a focus on life.\nLaura Oldanie, Rich and Resilient Living Caroline Chomanics, IDEASForUs / Chomanics Consulting Kendrick Henry, Grow Moringa Desiree’ Sims, Peas and Love Edible Landscapes Tara Hubbard, TakeMAR / Wonderfield Farm \u0026amp; Retreat Idea Hour (7 min talks) Laura Oldanie - Decentralized Intentional Communities\nLev Pasikhov - Florida Fruit Coop\nDee Morales - 813 Hood Garden\nDahveed Montané - Sociocracy\nKayla Caselli, City of Tampa Sustainability Coordinator - City of Tampa\u0026rsquo;s Sustainability Progress\nRick Scolaro - Regeneration and Star Trek: A Vision for the Future\nKoreen Brennan - We Regenerate: Solutions Hub for Florida\nSlot Available\n","permalink":"https://regeneratetampabay.org/posts/speakers/","summary":"List of panels and speakers","title":"Speakers"}]
