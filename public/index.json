[{"content":"\rThe Loess Plateau restoration in China is the largest scale regenerative land restoration project to date, restoring over 35,000 square kilometers (an area the size of Belgium) between 1995 and 2007. This land was barren for thousands of years prior to restoration, showing an incredible case example of the power of regenerative practices to restore degraded ecosystems.\nWhat is regeneration? \u0026ldquo;Regeneration means putting life at the center of every action and decision. It\u0026rsquo;s an inclusive and effective strategy to end the climate crisis in one generation.\u0026rdquo;\nPaul Hawken, Author of \u0026ldquo;Regeneration: Ending the climate crisis in one generation\u0026rdquo;\nRegenerative solutions support life by creating the conditions for both nature and humans to thrive. This is accomplished by restoring, renewing or revitalizing our own sources of materials and energy.\n“Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create resilient and equitable systems that integrate the needs of society with maintaining healthy ecologies. Regenerative designers use systems thinking, applied permaculture design principles, and community development processes to design human and ecological systems.\nThis approach can be applied to agriculture, architecture, community planning, cities, enterprises, economics and ecosystems.\u0026quot; A regenerative business might offer a product that heals nature and helps humans, and in addition might use renewable energy, reduce waste, use green suppliers, focus on its local community, take good care of its employees, and give back to the community. Regenerative practice and design goes beyond sustainability to heal and improve ecological systems and our own lives. This approach, achieved through a holistic approach that anybody can learn to do, is creating solutions that help both the earth and us, creating health and abundance.\nSo how is regeneration different from sustainability?\nSustainability means to make things last, to maintain things as they are. For most people, this implies continuing to conduct business as usual, but reducing or eliminating the damage done in the process. One problem with this approach is that it is often not feasible to continue doing things the way we have because some of the things our society is doing are destructive, or “degenerative,” at their core. For instance, there is likely no way to make fossil fuels sustainable. The extraction, processing and use of them all create multiple forms of damage that cannot be repaired at the pace it is created.\nAn example of practices considered sustainable would be solar panels. The mining, creation, delivery and discard of them all have degenerative elements, though using solar can prevent even worse damage from fossil fuels, and is thus more sustainable. It can even allow regeneration of damaged landscapes and health by reducing use of fossil fuels.\nDegenerative practices result in the active destruction of resources, species, human health and well-being, etc, and can destroy the ability of these systems to recover without considerable aid. Examples include mountaintop removal for coal, clear cutting jungles that result in desertification, or using agricultural practices that destroy water quality, topsoil and fertility.\nRegeneration actively improves systems, heals damage, and creates more potential and abundance than what is used up. This is done through processes that restore, renew or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials. Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create systems that provide for the needs of both humans and nature while healing both.\nRegenerative solutions are often very creative, innovative and outside of the box of “business as usual.” They usually offer multiple benefits across sectors. For instance, regenerative agriculture builds soil, increases infiltration of rainwater, promotes healthy vegetation and wildlife habitat, creates more nutrient-dense food, doesn’t release poisons into the water and soil, and captures carbon, among other benefits. It heals both nature and people.\nRegenerative solutions can appear more challenging than “business as usual.” As we continue to degrade our environment, there will be a point where business as usual is obviously more challenging than regenerative solutions. When taking into consideration the full costs of degenerative practices, regenerative solutions are less expensive, more successful and easier to implement than degenerative ones, but few people are aware of the extent of this.\nA major purpose of this website is to increase and accelerate access to those solutions in a number of different ways. Because climate change is a major concern for many of us, and because many of the best solutions to this are not broadly communicated or known, we are especially interested in supporting solutions that address this issue.\nMore information: Courtesy of ","permalink":"https://regeneratetampabay.org/resource-library/intro-to-regeneration/","summary":"A place to start if regeneration is totally new to you.","title":"Intro to Regeneration"},{"content":"Morning Location Time Activity Meet in front of Farmhouse 10:00 - 10:30am Sweetwater Farm Tour with Cristy Abbott Main Stage 10:30 - 11:00am Opening Circle Main Stage 11:00 - 11:45am Intergenerational Exploration Workshop with Donna Angelou Farm House 11:00 - 12:00pm Regenerative Business Panel Connections Barn All morning Connections Mapping / We Regenerate Market All morning Vending and Tabling Early Afternoon Location Time Activity Meet in front of Farmhouse 12:30 - 1:30pm Learning from Nature Workshop with Liztere Fiol and Caleb Quaid Zone 00 1:30 - 2:30pm Sound Healing w/ Jennifer McClure Farmhouse 12:30 - 1:15pm Intro to Permaculture w/ Bill Bilodeau School House 1:30 - 2:15pm Heart Walk Celebration w/ Cindy Casterlin Main Stage 1:30 - 2:30pm Food System Panel Meet in front of Farmhouse 1:30 - 2:30pm Rainwater Harvesting Tour with Diane Willis School House 2:30 - 3:15pm Toy Swap Connections Barn All afternoon Connections Mapping / We Regenerate Market All afternoon Vending and Tabling Late Afternoon Location Time Activity Main Stage 3:00 - 4:00pm Land and Water Use Panel Zone 00 3:00 - 4:00pm Open School House 3:30 - 4:15pm Garden Grampa Lasagna Composting with Albert Risemberg Main Stage 4:30 - 6:00pm Elder Wisdom Panel Zone 00 5:00 - 5:45pm Zone 00 All Ages Embodiment with Tatiana Rodeiro Connections Barn All afternoon Connections Mapping / We Regenerate Market All afternoon Vending and Tabling Evening Location Time Activity Zone 00 6:30 - 9:00pm 00 Lounge Main Stage 6:30 - 7:30pm Idea Hour Fire Pit 7:00 - 9:00pm Fireside Chat / S\u0026rsquo;mores Main Stage 7:45 - 9:00pm Music with Sunya Connections Barn All afternoon Connections Mapping / We Regenerate Market All afternoon Vending and Tabling ","permalink":"https://regeneratetampabay.org/posts/schedule/","summary":"View the itinerary","title":"Schedule"},{"content":"\rElder Wisdom Panel Community elders share experience in a free-flowing dialogue style panel.\nBill Bilodeau, Urban Ag Elder\nKoreen Brennan, Grow Permaculture\nSharon Joy Kleitsch, Meta-Networker\nJungle Jay Hardman, Beacon Food Forest\nCristy Abbott, Permaculture Elder\nFood Systems Panel Discussion of food security and local food systems with public, non-profit, and permaculture representatives.\nMonica Petrella, Homegrown Hillsborough\nHarrison Soberanis, Dream Builders Mission\nAlbert Risemberg, Moon Landing Garden \u0026amp; Apiary\nJon Butts, EcoFarm\nErica Hall, Florida Food Policy Council\nJoe Dalessio, Meacham Urban Farm\nLand and Water Use Panel Discussion of issues involving land, water and climate in the Tampa Bay area, with permaculture, ecology, and policy change experts.\nKen Benway, Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice\nSusan Glickman, CLEO Institute / Policy Advocate\nDiane Willis, Wetland Scientist and Rainwater Harvesting Expert\nRegenerative Business Local entrepreneurs discuss navigating business with a focus on life.\nLaura Oldanie, Rich and Resilient Living Caroline Chomanics, IDEASForUs / Chomanics Consulting Kendrick Henry, Grow Moringa Desiree’ Sims, Peas and Love Edible Landscapes Tara Hubbard, TakeMAR / Wonderfield Farm \u0026amp; Retreat Idea Hour (7 min talks) Calli Marshall - Eckerd College Farm\nLaura Oldanie - Decentralized Intentional Communities\nFatima \u0026amp; Alex - 813 Hood Garden and Tampa Heights Junior Civic Association\nKoreen Brennan - We Regenerate: Solutions Hub for Florida\nKayla Caselli, City of Tampa Sustainability Coordinator - City of Tampa\u0026rsquo;s Sustainability Progress\nDahveed Montané - Sociocracy\nRick Scolaro - Regeneration and Star Trek: A Vision for the Future\nLev Pasikhov - Florida Fruit Coop\n","permalink":"https://regeneratetampabay.org/posts/speakers/","summary":"List of panels and speakers","title":"Speakers"}]
