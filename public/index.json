[{"content":"\rThe Loess Plateau restoration in China is the largest scale regenerative land restoration project to date, restoring over 35,000 square kilometers (an area the size of Belgium) between 1995 and 2007. This land was barren for thousands of years prior to restoration, showing an incredible case example of the power of regenerative practices to restore degraded ecosystems.\nWhat is Regeneration? \u0026ldquo;Regeneration means putting life at the center of every action and decision. It\u0026rsquo;s an inclusive and effective strategy to end the climate crisis in one generation.\u0026rdquo;\nPaul Hawken, Author of \u0026ldquo;Regeneration: Ending the climate crisis in one generation\u0026rdquo;\nUntil recently, almost all talk on regeneration focused on regenerative agriculture and land restoration projects. As the benefits of regeneration continue to be proven in larger studies, regeneration is becoming a movement that rethinks traditional communities, industries, and businesses through a lens of connection with nature and restoring life through our actions.\nIn contrast to traditional industrial agriculture, which uses fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and unsustainable irrigation to grow mostly monoculture crops, regenerative agriculture focuses first on soil health as the building block for a healthy food production system. Healthy soil grows healthy food, cleans water, provides habitat for wildlife, and pulls Co2 out of the atmosphere and turns it into organic carbon in the soil and plants.\nRegenerative land restoration projects focus on capturing rainwater and storing it in the soil as the basis for restoring local ecosystems with world-changing potential! The Loess Plateau project, for example, restored 35,000 square kilometers (an area the size of the country of Belgium) from barren land to thriving farm and pasture in just a 12-year period using regenerative practices. Similar projects all over the world have shown that even in harshest environments (like Rwandan and Ethiopian deserts), regeneration can bring life back from the dead.\nRegenerative buildings rethink the built environment, focusing on incorporating nature into design through integrated environmental design and biomimicry (learning and mimicking nature\u0026rsquo;s strategies to solve human design issues). Increasingly, communities and construction projects are looking at cutting-edge design solutions, like the Living Building Challenge, to create buildings that are a benefit to the surrounding environment.\nRegenerative communities are also emerging around the world. They aim to support all life and human lifestyle in a way that creates health, happiness, and connection. These communities focus on local resiliency, habitat preservation, sustainable energy use, and connection with nature.\nRegeneration puts life at the center of decision-making, which leads to projects, systems and communities that are more resilient and adapted to changing political and environmental challenges. As the movement grows, regeneration can be expanded to regional, national, and global levels, to help realize the more beautiful world that our hearts know is possible.\nWant to discuss your regenerative shift? Let\u0026rsquo;s talk!\nWhy Regeneration? Draw Down Carbon! We have a carbon problem. Well, really, we have a pollution problem. Carbon itself isn\u0026rsquo;t bad\u0026hellip; it is the building block of all life on earth. But, when we pollute carbon into the atmosphere heavily, it has consequences, including climate change. While stopping pollution and carbon emissions are critical, we also need solutions to drawdown the carbon that is already polluted.\nRegenerative soil management can sequester massive amounts of carbon if scaled globally. According to at least one study, we could sequester 100% of our annual CO2 emissions if all global cropland and pasture were regenerative. Oversimplified, plants breathe in CO2, breathe out oxygen, and keep the carbon. The world\u0026rsquo;s soil holds triple the carbon that is in the atmosphere! By using regenerative practices to increase the carbon in the soil, we can drawdown the carbon in the atmosphere and mitigate climate change.\nBuild and Sustain Life! When soil is healthy, it has more microorganisms in one handful than we have people on the planet. These small organisms are the foundation of the ecosystem and support all plant, insect, animal, and human life, along with making beautiful healthy soil. As we look for solutions to this great mass extinction, creating habitat through regenerative practices is one of the great opportunities before us!\nWant to discuss your regenerative shift? Let\u0026rsquo;s talk!\nWant to dive deeper? Resources/Education\n","permalink":"https://regenerative-shift.pages.dev/learn/intro-to-regeneration/","summary":"A place to start if regeneration is totally new to you.","title":"Intro to Regeneration"},{"content":"Thought Leaders / Inspiration: Charles Eisenstein (Link)\nCharles authored \u0026ldquo;Climate: A New Story\u0026rdquo; and many articles that speak to the interconnectedness of nature, which is a key understanding of regeneration.

48C provides $10 billion in funding for advanced energy projects, including solar, wind, electric vehicles, green infrastructure, critical materials, and carbon capture technologies.\nUpgrades in energy-intensive sectors like cement, iron, steel, aluminum, and chemical manufacturing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are also eligible for funding.\nRound 1 funding of $4 billion has a deadline to submit Concept Papers to the Department of Energy by July 31, 2023, with Round 2 of funding for the remaining $6 billion anticipated in 2024.\nTo be eligible for the credit, the Department of Energy must recommend the project through a competitive review process.\nThe process involves submitting a Concept Paper and an application, with a DOE informational webinar scheduled for June 27, 2023.\nThere are three categories of eligible projects: Clean Energy Manufacturing and Recycling, Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction, and Critical Materials.\nEach category has specific criteria for evaluation, including commercial viability, greenhouse gas emissions impacts, strengthening US supply chains, and workforce/community engagement.\nEnergy Communities Census tracts will receive specific funds, with approximately $1.6 billion allocated in Round 1.\nTo follow developments: DOE informational webinar is scheduled for June 27, 2023. Note: Information is summarized IRS documents that are linked from notices on May 31, 2023 and February 13, 2023. It is current as of June 20, 2023.\nSection 48C: Advanced Energy Project Credit Through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), $10 billion is allocated to investment tax credits under Section 48C for advanced energy projects. Each project is eligible for a 30% investment tax credit (subject to meeting certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements) for project costs for tangible property, not including the building or its structural components. Through subsequent guidance, most notably IRS Notice 2023-44 on May 31st, advanced energy projects fit into one of three categories:\nClean Energy Manufacturing and Recycling Projects (9 Subcategories)\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions Projects\nCritical Materials Projects\nTo be eligible for tax credits, the project may not be placed in service prior to award allocation. DOE will evaluate and recommend projects based on four (4) technical review criteria:\nCommercial viability\nGreenhouse gas emissions impacts\nStrengthening US supply chains and domestic manufacturing for a net-zero economy\nWorkforce and community engagement\nProgram Timing and Process 48C will have at least two rounds of allocation, with Round 1 closing for Concept Papers on July 31, 2023. Round 2 has not yet been announced, but is anticipated to likely be after March 31, 2024, which is the deadline for awards of Round 1 allocations.\nIn Round 1, the IRS anticipates awarding up to $4 billion of 48C credits with approximately $1.6 billion being allocated to projects in Energy Communities Census tracts. To apply for the credit is a multi-step process, with feedback from the Department of Energy (DOE) along the way.\nStep 1: Concept Paper\nBy July 31st, interested applicants must submit a concept paper through the DOE exCHANGE Portal that outlines requested information on the proposed project. The DOE will perform a review of the concept paper and send the applicant a letter either encouraging or discouraging the submission of a 48C application.\nStep 2: Application\nWhether the DOE provides encouragement or discouragement for the concept paper, applicant may still complete the application, although projects that are discouraged from applying are less likely to be allocated funds. The application is a more detailed project plan that addresses feasibility and technical aspects of the project. The DOE will review each application and provide recommendations to the IRS regarding acceptance or rejection of each application. The IRS will approve projects for the tax credit and sends a letter of notification to the applicant.\nThe IRS will make all Round 1 allocation decisions by March 31, 2024. Step 3 and Beyond\nAfter receiving an allocation of the credit from the IRS, the approved application (taxpayer) has two (2) years to notify DOE that the certification requirements have been met by submitting this through the exCHANGE portal. The IRS issues a Certification Letter. Within two (2) years of receiving the Certification Letter, the taxpayer notifies DOE the project has been placed into service, and then can claim the tax credit on that year’s return.\nCategories of Eligible Projects There is a host of eligible projects in three categories (and their subcategories).\nClean Energy Manufacturing and Recycling Projects (9 Subcategories) A qualifying advanced energy project in this category re-equips, expands or establishes an industrial or manufacturing facility for the production or recycling of specified advanced energy property:\nProperty designed to be used to manufacture products that produce energy from the sun, wind, or geothermal deposits.\nExamples: Solar panels, wind turbines, offshore wind platforms, geothermal turbines and heat pumps, components for solar, wind, and geothermal equipment Fuel cells, microturbines or energy storage systems and components\nExamples: stationary batteries, stationary hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen storage vessels, microturbines for combined heat and power systems, and components. Electric grid modernization equipment\nExamples: power flow, control, and conversion, such as transformers, power electronics, advanced meters, breakers, switchgears and more. Carbon Capture Equipment\nEquipment that is necessary to compress, treat, process, liquify, pump, or perform some other physical action to capture carbon oxide emissions. Examples: solvents, membranes, chemical processing equipment, compressors, monitoring equipment, injection equipment, and more. Renewable, Low-Emission Fuel, Chemical or Product\nExamples: clean hydrogen, low-emission ammonia, renewable biofuels, basic organic chemicals, polymers and resins. Energy Conservation Technologies (including residential, commercial and industrial applications)\nTechnologies that are eligible for residential or commercial efficiency improvements for purposes of the 25C tax credit or the 179D tax deduction, as well as equipment with direct net energy use reduction, such as ultra-efficient heat pumps, insulation, ultra-efficient hot water systems, sensors, and controls Electric Vehicles, Fuel Cell Vehicles, Components and Infrastructure\nExamples: Electric cars, trucks and buses, electric vehicle supply equipment, charging equipment, hydrogen refueling stations equipment, components of these systems Hybrid Vehicles over 14,000 lbs\nExamples: equipment and components for hybrid vehicles over 14,000 lbs Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHS) Reduction Projects (5 Subcategories) A qualifying advanced energy project in this category re-equips an industrial or manufacturing facility, including in energy-intensive manufacturing sections, such as cement, iron, steel, aluminum, chemicals and other sectors, with equipment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 percent through installation of one or more the following:\nLow-or zero-carbon process heat systems\nExamples: installation combined heat and power, thermal storage technologies, other heating systems based on electricity, clean hydrogen, biomass or waste heat recovery Carbon capture, transport, utilization and storage systems\nExamples: equipment necessary to compress, treat, process, liquify, pump or perform some other physical action that capture carbon oxides, along with the specialized equipment needed for transport and storage of carbon oxides. Energy efficiency and reduction in waste from industrial processes\nExamples: technologies that reduce direct fuel use, electricity use, or waste in industrial applications, such as heat pumps, combined heat and power systems, insulation, sensors, controls and smart energy management Any other industrial technology designed to reduce GHG emissions, as determined by the Secretary of Energy\nCritical Materials A qualifying advanced energy project in this category re-equips, expands or establishes an industrial facility for the processing, refining, or recycling of critical materials as defined by the Energy Act of 2020. For Round 1, critical materials consist of:\n2022 Final List of Critical Materials\nAny additional critical materials as determined by the Secretary of Energy published no later than July 31, 2023, available at: https://www.energy.gov/criticalmaterials\nDOE Review Criteria Each of the three project categories (with subcategories) has Concept Paper and Application requirements that are divided into four review criteria.\nCommercial viability\nIdentifying projects with the lowest levelized cost, shortest time frame for completion, lowest risk, and highest impact Greenhouse gas emissions impacts\nIdentifying projects with the greatest net impacts in avoiding or reducing anthropogenic emissions of GHG Strengthening US supply chains and domestic manufacturing for a net-zero economy\nIdentifying projects with the greatest impact on domestic job creation and potential for technological innovation and commercial deployment Workforce and community engagement\nIdentifying projects with the workforce and community support that will lead to domestic job creation, reduce barriers that may otherwise increase project completion time, and have an impact on avoiding or reducing local pollution, including non-greenhouse gas air pollution. Energy Communities Census Tracts DOE will allocate specific funds (at least approximately $1.6 billion of the $4 billion in funds in Round 1) to Energy Communities as published on by the IRS Energy Community Census Tract List. Conclusion The Inflation Reduction Act\u0026rsquo;s Section 48C $10 billion tax credit presents a significant opportunity for businesses to advance sustainable practices and contribute to the transition towards a net-zero economy. With the first round of funding closing on July 31, 2023, interested applicants must submit a Concept Paper outlining their proposed project. By aligning projects with the criteria outlined by the DOE, businesses can benefit from the investment tax credits up to 30%. A Final Thought: Pick the low hanging fruit…and plant the seeds. After your company saves a few million dollars on a project that your ESG or shareholder goals required through this tax credit, invest some of that savings into a life creating project. I often say that the Inflation Reduction Act creates an abundance of low hanging fruit – tax incentives that fund projects that need to happen anyway that have great ROI – and we should pick the fruit. After you pick the fruit, plant the seeds by investing in a project to create life on your property and business. What land or water do you steward, and how can you create life through your next decision?\nAbout the Author\nCaleb Quaid is the founder of Regenerative Shift, a Tampa-based environmental consulting firm, working with businesses and communities on regenerative environmental initiatives and sustainability programs. Regenerative Shift focuses on life-creating and cost-saving holistic programs, including regenerative land and water projects and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) consulting. As a public speaker, Caleb provides motivating insight into practical life-creating environmental practices and shows the business case for going green with tax incentives under the IRA and other legislation.\nNow what?\nThe Inflation Reduction Act can be a lot to navigate, and new guidance is issued every week. If you’d like to discuss how your business can benefit, Regenerative Shift is here to help! Set up a free consultation here!\n","permalink":"https://regenerative-shift.pages.dev/posts/understanding-section-48c-advanced-energy-project-credit/","summary":"Key Point Summary The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Section 48C provides $10 billion in funding for advanced energy projects, including solar, wind, electric vehicles, green infrastructure, critical materials, and carbon capture technologies.\nUpgrades in energy-intensive sectors like cement, iron, steel, aluminum, and chemical manufacturing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are also eligible for funding.\nRound 1 funding of $4 billion has a deadline to submit Concept Papers to the Department of Energy by July 31, 2023, with Round 2 of funding for the remaining $6 billion anticipated in 2024.","title":"Understanding Section 48C Advanced Energy Project Credit"},{"content":"In the market for a used electric vehicle? Check to see if the model of vehicle you want is eligible for a tax credit here: list of qualified vehicles\nBeginning January 1, 2023, if you buy a qualified used electric vehicle (EV) or fuel cell vehicle (FCV) from a licensed dealer for $25,000 or less, you may be eligible for a used clean vehicle tax credit under Section 25E of the Inflation Reduction Act equal to 30% of the sale price up to a maximum credit of $4,000.\nImportant: The credit is nonrefundable, so you can\u0026rsquo;t get back more on the credit than you owe in taxes, and you can\u0026rsquo;t apply any excess credit to future tax years.\nWho Qualifies?

This guidance is not yet official, as there is a review/comment period until June 30, 2023.\nUnder the proposed guidelines, qualified solar and wind projects located in Low-Income Communities may receive an additional 10% or 20% tax credit. However, the program is capped and competitive, so not all projects are likely to qualify.\nThe program prioritizes projects that benefit the low-income or tribal community they are in, rather than projects that solely benefit a business.\nAdditional selection criteria have been added to further promote projects that benefit electrical cooperatives and/or areas of high poverty.\nUnder the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 Section 48(e), qualified solar and wind projects under Section 48 Investment Tax Credit, could receive a 10% or 20% additional tax credit based on their location and/or benefit to low-income communities. This has potential to be huge for qualifying projects, as it can be stacked on top of the 30% ITC credit and potentially the 10% Domestic Content Credit to have 40-60% in tax credits on a new system (plus bonus depreciation! See Commercial Solar article for more details on the credits and depreciation.) On May 31, 2023, the IRS issued proposed rules concerning the Low-Income Communities Bonus credit. (See Notice 23-107 for full text). The proposed rules outline specific application procedures, additional allocation criteria, and applicable definitions necessary to apply for the 2023 calendar year. These proposed rules are not yet ratified, and there is a comment period until June 30, 2023, and a process to approve the final version still to come but serves as the best guidance to date on the program. Below are some questions and their answers based on what we know today.\nWhat types of projects are eligible? Qualified solar and wind projects are defined as facilities that:\nGenerate electricity solely from a wind facility, solar energy property, or small wind energy property;\nHave a maximum net output of less than 5 megawatts\nFit into at least one of the four categories of eligibility\nWhat are the project categories and capacity limits? The funding is tied to energy output, with a total funding of projects of 1.8 gigawatts of solar and wind projects, subdivided in categories. As most projects are under 1 megawatts (and the program has a 5 megawatt cap), this program will likely fund credits to several thousand projects this year in total.\nCategory Scenario Energy Output 1 Located in a Low-Income Community 700 megawatts 2 Located on Indian Land 200 megawatts 3 Qualified Low-Income Residential Building Project 200 megawatts 4 Qualified Low-Income Economic Benefit Project 700 megawatts The proposed rule change also notably sub-divides Category 1, so that 560 megawatts of capacity is allocated to projects that have eligible behind-the-meter residential uses, and only 140 megawatts for projects that don’t meet that criterion – most notably rooftop solar for commercial properties.\nWhere are Low Income Communities defined? Under § 48(e)(2)(A)(iii)(I), the term low-income community is generally defined under § 45D(e)(1), with certain modifications described elsewhere in § 45D(e), as any population census tract if the poverty rate for such tract is at least 20 percent, or, in the case of a tract not located within a metropolitan area, the median family income for such tract does not exceed 80 percent of statewide median family income, or in the case of a tract located within a metropolitan area, the median family income for such tract does not exceed 80 percent of the greater of statewide median family income or the metropolitan area median family income.\nMap: Low Income Community Map\nWhat are the Additional Selection Criteria? The proposed rule outlines two general criteria for projects, with at least 50% of the total Capacity Limitation being allocated to projects that meet at least one of the criteria (and priority given for any that meet both)\nOwnership Criteria\nA qualified solar and wind facility would meet the Ownership if it is owned by a Tribal Enterprise, an Alaska Native Corporation, a renewable energy cooperative, a qualified renewable energy company that meets certain ownership requirements, or a qualified tax-exempt entity.

However, the program is capped and competitive, so not all projects are likely to qualify.","title":"Navigating the Proposed IRS Rules for Low Income Community Bonus"},{"content":"On May 12, 2023, the IRS issued Notice 23-38 to outline the guidelines for projects that qualify for the Domestic Content Bonus Credit under Section 48 Investment Tax Credit or Section 45 Production Tax Credit in the Inflation Reduction Act. Below are key takeaways as you plan projects for your business.\nThis article will speak mostly about Commercial Solar projects under the Section 48 Investment Tax Credit.\nWhat projects does this apply to? This applies to the commercial renewable energy projects covered under Section 48 and Section 45 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Most notably because of their widespread adoption, this includes commercial solar projects. It also includes wind, geothermal, battery storage, combined heating and power and other less-adopted technologies. It applies to commercial installations, including businesses, nonprofits, state and local governments, churches, colleges and universities, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and tribal governments. It doesn’t apply to residential projects, which are credited elsewhere in the Inflation Reduction Act.\nHow much credit can my project qualify for? Generally, the Inflation Reduction Act provides a 30% tax credit for qualifying projects under Section 48 of the Investment Tax Credit. Each type of project has its own guidelines, so as you consider different renewable energy projects, it will be important to dive into the specifics of your project. For solar projects, projects over 1 megawatt (MW) have additional requirements. However, for projects under 1 MW (most projects currently), the credit is 30%, plus any applicable bonus credits.\nThe Domestic Content Bonus Credit (DCBC) provides an additional 10%, so that projects would qualify for a 40% total credit (plus accelerated depreciation – for more details on depreciation, see this article).\nWhat are the Domestic Content requirements? Tied to the “Buy America Requirements”, the bonus credit requires the products and components being manufactured in the United States. Steel and Iron: 100% of all structural steel and iron is required to be manufactured in the United States**. For solar projects, this would include any tracks / framing that support the panels. The notice specifically indicates that this requirement does not apply to steel or used in components and subcomponents, such as nuts, bolts, screws, washers, cabinets, covers, shelves, clamps, fittings, sleeves, adapters, tie wire, spacers, door hinges and similar items that are made primarily of steel or iron but are not structural in function. Manufactured Products: The notice provides definitions, details, and examples that I encourage you to read or consult with a specialist about. In short, in 2023, for commercial solar projects, at least 40% of the manufactured products and components (as determined by the cost of the products) must be manufactured in the United States to qualify. This percentage will increase to 55% beginning in 2026.\nHow do I know if my system qualifies for the Domestic Content Bonus Credit? As you’re selecting solar contractors and/or manufacturers for panels, inverters, and framing, it is critical that you ask for documentation of the Domestic Content to ensure that you meet these criteria and get the bonus. Because the guidance was just issued today (as of the date of this article), even domestic solar manufacturers such as First Solar, QCells, SILFAB, and Mission Solar will need to document that their components meet the requirements of the IRS notice. Additionally, the United States currently has limited manufacturing of solar inverters, which are also critical components of a solar system.\nIn the coming months, it is likely that the Department of Energy will publish a list of qualifying manufacturers. More manufacturers will also have ready-made information marketing their compliance. Until then, if you are doing a solar project, there is no substitute for asking the questions, documenting the responses in writing, and/or working with someone who can help you navigate this process.\nWhat else should I know about the Inflation Reduction Act? Tax incentives for Commercial Solar have been increased greatly under the Inflation Reduction Act, as have incentives for energy efficiency projects (LED lighting, HVAC upgrades, insulation). There are over 100 different programs in the act, and almost every business, community, non-profit, and homeowner can benefit! Now is the time to incorporate these high-ROI projects into your planning for 2023 and beyond!\nAbout the Author\nCaleb Quaid is the founder of Regenerative Shift, a Tampa-based environmental consulting firm, working with businesses and communities on regenerative environmental initiatives and sustainability programs. Regenerative Shift focuses on life-creating and cost-saving holistic programs, including regenerative land and water projects and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) consulting. As a public speaker, Caleb provides motivating insight into practical life-creating environmental practices and shows the business case for going green with tax incentives under the IRA.\nNow what?

The tax deduction is much larger now. The deduction has a sliding scale based on energy efficiency modeling, with $2.50 - $5.00 per square foot. For example, a 25,000 square foot building that undergoes an upgrade can potentially earn up to a $125,000 tax deduction in 2023! That same project last year would have been just up to $45,000.\nThe project you’re doing is likely eligible. In addition to commercial building and renovations, the IRA expanded 179D to include deductions for projects for Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT), state and municipal governments, not-for-profit organizations, schools, churches, universities, museums, and more. Almost every project should be looking at how to maximize this deduction. Compared to 2007 Standards. Projects in 2023 are compared to ASHRAE 90.1 2007. Because of the current energy code, most new construction will qualify for at least $2.50 per square foot deduction, even if energy efficiency is not a primary project consideration. Just by meeting current energy code with LED lighting, insulation and mechanical efficiency, your project likely is at least 25% more efficient than the 2007 standards, which didn’t require LED lighting and had lower efficiency requirements. How do I qualify? Get an energy model. The project must develop a qualified energy model that compared the efficiency of the design to the 2007 ASHRAE standard noted above. The amount of the deduction is a sliding scale of $2.50 - $5.00 based on the percentage of efficiency compared to this standard, with 25% being the minimum and 50% or more qualifying for the maximum deduction. For example, a project that shows through an energy model to have a 41% efficiency compared to ASHRAE 90.1 2007, would be eligible for a deduction of $4.10 per square foot.\nMeet Prevailing Wage requirements. To qualify for the deduction, the project must document that across all trades and labor classifications laborers and mechanics were paid at least the prevailing wage for their location and job function. This increases documentation and record-keeping requirements but is done to ensure that projects that benefit from government incentives are paying their workers a prevailing wage.\nMeet apprenticeship requirements. Similarly to wage requirements, projects must adhere to apprenticeship requirements. In short, for projects in 2023, 12.5% of labor hours need to be documented as qualified apprenticeship labor hours. This increases to 15% in 2024. If apprenticeship labor hours cannot be met, documentation of a good faith effort can suffice as apprenticeship programs ramp up. What do I need to do? General Contractors Commercial GCs will bear the burden of documentation, particularly for the Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship requirements. GCs should look at all projects in construction and in the pipeline and start a documentation process with all subcontractors of labor. Either designate an internal contact or hire an outside consultant to coordinate and verify prevailing wages and apprenticeships.\nProject Stakeholders (Owners, Project Managers, etc.) Determine (based on square footage) whether it’s worth the effort to pursue the deduction. Generally speaking, if a project is smaller than 10,000 square feet, the cost to complete an energy model and document the project will likely offset the value of the deduction. As the project gets larger, the value of the deduction increases compared to the cost to model and document.\nTrade Contractors Electricians, plumbers, HVAC contractors, carpenters, and all trades should begin to research and document apprenticeships and prevailing wages. This will soon be a standard requirement on all commercial jobs so that they can qualify for 179D deductions.\nWhere do I go for help? Regenerative Shift provides consulting services on 179D and other programs in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. We can coordinate turnkey energy modeling, assist in documenting prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, and work with all stakeholders to maximize the value of the deduction for the project.\nYour situation is unique. Contact Caleb Quaid at info@regenerativeshift.com or set up a meeting through Calendly to discuss.\nSources:\n1. https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/a-23-01.pdf\n2. https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/IRA\n","permalink":"https://regenerative-shift.pages.dev/posts/what-to-know-on-ira-section-179d/","summary":"Summary The 179D Deduction is a tax incentive that every project manager, owner, and contractor involved in commercial projects needs to understand. Almost every commercial construction project underway in the United States today can potentially qualify for up to a $5.00 per square foot tax deduction, often without modifying plans from current design. Documentation requirements are high but can be easily managed by an energy consulting and accounting firm to maximize the deduction without a hassle.","title":"Huge Change to Commercial Construction in 2023!

For the first time with the IRA, battery storage for solar systems is incentivized through credits and deductions. For projects that are considering investment in systems to generate and store power on-site, this makes storage much more affordable.\nNon-Profits, States and Municipalities – Direct Payments! Under the IRA, Tax Exempt organizations (i.e. non-profits, universities, churches), States, tribes, and municipalities can receive direct payment from the federal government of eligible projects. This means that a non-profit that puts solar on their headquarters can receive a 30% (or 40%-60%) check, while financing the system off of previously budgeted electricity bills. This changes the financial equation for solar for those that qualify!\nCarbon Footprint Impact In addition to the direct financial value through electricity savings and tax credits that solar can bring a business, the transition to renewable energy is a reality that every business will face in the near future. Solar is the lowest hanging fruit in sustainability, providing a huge carbon footprint reduction while providing enormous financial return on investment. Your business can document and market your carbon savings, while it is still marketable instead of mandated.\nReinvest the Savings Instead of pocketing all of the savings that the come from solar, put some back into creating life! For example, set aside the difference between your solar payment and your old electricity bill to go towards projects that support your local environment and community. Plant trees and mangroves! Start a compost program! Put life at the center of your business!\nAbout the Author\nCaleb Quaid is the founder of Regenerative Shift, a Tampa-based environmental consulting firm, working with businesses and communities on regenerative environmental initiatives and sustainability programs. Regenerative Shift focuses on life-creating and cost-saving holistic programs, including regenerative land and water projects and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) consulting. As a public speaker, Caleb provides motivating insight into practical life-creating environmental practices and shows the business case for going green with tax incentives under the IRA.\nNow what?\nThe IRA can be a lot to navigate, and new guidance is issued every week. If you’d like to discuss how your business can benefit, Regenerative Shift is here to help! Reach out today at info@regenerativeshift.com to set up a free consultation!\n","permalink":"https://regenerative-shift.pages.dev/posts/ira-and-solar/","summary":"Note: Much of this info is summarized from Energy.gov, IRS.gov, and WhiteHouse.gov. More details, sources, and information about additional tax credits can be found here.\nFor many years, solar has had great tax incentives to support commercial solar projects. Now with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in Aug. 2022, provides credits and depreciation deductions that combine to give Year 1 2023 tax incentives that cover 47% (or more) of system cost!","title":"What to know about the Inflation Reduction Act and Commercial Solar"},{"content":"Regenerative Shift assists in the transition steps (large or little) that businesses and individuals want to make to create resiliency and a connection with nature.
