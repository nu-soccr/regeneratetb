      <guid>https://regenerativeshift.com/posts/understanding-section-48c-advanced-energy-project-credit/</guid>
      <description>Key Point Summary The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Section 48C provides $10 billion in funding for advanced energy projects, including solar, wind, electric vehicles, green infrastructure, critical materials, and carbon capture technologies.
Upgrades in energy-intensive sectors like cement, iron, steel, aluminum, and chemical manufacturing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are also eligible for funding.
Round 1 funding of $4 billion has a deadline to submit Concept Papers to the Department of Energy by July 31, 2023, with Round 2 of funding for the remaining $6 billion anticipated in 2024.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Proposed IRS Rules for Low Income Community Bonus</title>
      <link>https://regenerativeshift.com/posts/navigating-the-proposed-irs-rules-for-low-income-community-bonus/</link>

      <guid>https://regenerativeshift.com/posts/navigating-the-proposed-irs-rules-for-low-income-community-bonus/</guid>
      <description>Key Points Summary The IRS has issued proposed guidance for applying and qualifying for the Low-Income Community bonus for small commercial Solar and Wind projects (under 5 megawatts). This guidance is not yet official, as there is a review/comment period until June 30, 2023.
Under the proposed guidelines, qualified solar and wind projects located in Low-Income Communities may receive an additional 10% or 20% tax credit. However, the program is capped and competitive, so not all projects are likely to qualify.</description>

      <title>Huge Change to Commercial Construction in 2023! What to know on IRA Section 179D</title>
      <link>https://regenerativeshift.com/posts/what-to-know-on-ira-section-179d/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Apr 2023 22:01:22 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://regenerativeshift.com/posts/what-to-know-on-ira-section-179d/</guid>
      <description>Summary The 179D Deduction is a tax incentive that every project manager, owner, and contractor involved in commercial projects needs to understand. Almost every commercial construction project underway in the United States today can potentially qualify for up to a $5.00 per square foot tax deduction, often without modifying plans from current design. Documentation requirements are high but can be easily managed by an energy consulting and accounting firm to maximize the deduction without a hassle.</description>

      <title>What to know about the Inflation Reduction Act and Commercial Solar</title>
      <link>https://regenerativeshift.com/posts/ira-and-solar/</link>

      <guid>https://regenerativeshift.com/posts/ira-and-solar/</guid>
      <description>Note: Much of this info is summarized from Energy.gov, IRS.gov, and WhiteHouse.gov. More details, sources, and information about additional tax credits can be found here.
For many years, solar has had great tax incentives to support commercial solar projects. Now with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), passed in Aug. 2022, provides credits and depreciation deductions that combine to give Year 1 2023 tax incentives that cover 47% (or more) of system cost!</description>

      <description>Raymond James Stadium Living Fence In February 2022, Raymond James Stadium installed an 1,100 ft living fence of bamboo and native plants to provide an environmentally-friendly barrier to stop unauthorized vehicle access to their property.
In lieu of an aluminum fence, which is extractive, this living fence sequesters carbon and provides habitat for native wildlife.
The project is considered the first regenerative planting project in North American professional sports and garnered TV news.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;No civilization has outlived the usefulness of its soils. When the soil is destroyed, the nation is gone.&amp;rdquo;
-Lloyd Noble, 1949 Founder of the Noble Research Institute
As the signs of climate change and environmental damage become more obvious, caring for the land in our stewardship is critical for communities, organizations, and individuals alike. A shift in mindset to regenerative environmental management may be the most important climate-related decision that we can individually and collectively make.</description>
