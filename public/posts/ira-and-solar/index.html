For the first time with the IRA, battery storage for solar systems is incentivized through credits and deductions. For projects that are considering investment in systems to generate and store power on-site, this makes storage much more affordable.\nNon-Profits, States and Municipalities – Direct Payments! Under the IRA, Tax Exempt organizations (i.e. non-profits, universities, churches), States, tribes, and municipalities can receive direct payment from the federal government of eligible projects. This means that a non-profit that puts solar on their headquarters can receive a 30% (or 40%-60%) check, while financing the system off of previously budgeted electricity bills. This changes the financial equation for solar for those that qualify!\nCarbon Footprint Impact In addition to the direct financial value through electricity savings and tax credits that solar can bring a business, the transition to renewable energy is a reality that every business will face in the near future. Solar is the lowest hanging fruit in sustainability, providing a huge carbon footprint reduction while providing enormous financial return on investment. Your business can document and market your carbon savings, while it is still marketable instead of mandated.\nReinvest the Savings Instead of pocketing all of the savings that the come from solar, put some back into creating life! For example, set aside the difference between your solar payment and your old electricity bill to go towards projects that support your local environment and community. Plant trees and mangroves! Start a compost program! Put life at the center of your business!\nAbout the Author\nCaleb Quaid is the founder of Regenerative Shift, a Tampa-based environmental consulting firm, working with businesses and communities on regenerative environmental initiatives and sustainability programs. Regenerative Shift focuses on life-creating and cost-saving holistic programs, including regenerative land and water projects and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) consulting. As a public speaker, Caleb provides motivating
